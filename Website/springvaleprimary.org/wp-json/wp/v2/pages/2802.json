We aim to develop an understanding of British history and that of the wider world. We work to develop an understanding of chronology as well as a knowledge and understanding of how the local area has changed over time. The children are given the opportunity to examine, interpret and evaluate a variety of sources in order to make deductions about the past. They are taught to think and behave as historians and archaeologists. The children are also encouraged to pose their own historical questions. We investigate how and why the world has changed as well as what we can learn from the past to make the future a better place. British Values are woven into the History curriculum promoting values such as Mutual Respect, Tolerance and Individual Liberty. Themed days\/months, such as Black History Month\u00a0 and Remembrance as well as assemblies also promote such values. Further themed days, visitors and school visits are used within the History curriculum to develop a deeper understanding of the time periods studied and to inspire the children so that they have a lifelong love of History.\u00a0 Also, we have a weekly report, provided by two year 5 pupils, to display \u2018A Day In History\u2019 in order to foster enthusiasm and expand historical knowledge. A different artefact is displayed weekly in a central area, which pupils are encouraged \u00a0to investigate and research.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>GEOGRAPHY<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Coverage of the Curriculum<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/springvaleprimary.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/new-NC-geography-plans.docx\">New NC Geography Plans<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Geography is also covered through cross curricular topic work. Geographical work starts with the youngest children studying the relationship between places which they know and using play maps for cars, and develops to compass work, the interpretation of maps and the study of places beyond the pupil\u2019s experience.<\/p>\n<p>At Springvale Primary, it is our intention that Geography will inspire pupils with a curiosity and fascination about the world and its people that will remain with them throughout their lives. We aim to offer opportunities for children to explore the world in order to develop an understanding of the human and physical world in which they live in and their place within it. We aim to promote the children\u2019s interest and understanding about diverse places, people, resources and natural and human environments, together with a deep understanding of the Earth\u2019s key physical and human processes. It is our intention that Geography will promote children\u2019s spiritual, moral, social and cultural development helping them to have a greater understanding of their place in the world, and their rights and responsibilities to other people and the environment.\u00a0 We encourage the children to ask questions about the world and provide opportunities for them to develop geographical skills and knowledge to be able to answer them.<\/p>\n<p>Through our Geography curriculum we aim to develop skills and knowledge that the children can use throughout their life including: \u2022 Developing an age-appropriate, accurate knowledge of the location of a wide range of globally significant places and develop their skills in describing the physical and human characteristics of these places. \u2022 Using their locational knowledge to provide a geographical context in which to study and understand important geographical processes. \u2022 Developing an understanding that these key processes play a vital role in the development of key physical world in which they live in and their place within it. We aim to promote the children\u2019s interest and understanding about diverse places, people, resources and natural and human environments, together with a deep understanding of the Earth\u2019s key physical and human processes<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>They should be able to discuss the interdependence of physical and human geography and how they bring about variation and change to the geographical landscape of an area.\u00a0 \u2022 Developing their ability to use key geographical vocabulary which is appropriate and accurate and which evolves from EYFS to Key stage 1 and through to key stage 2. \u2022 They should develop the skills to use and interpret a wide range of sources of geographical information including maps, diagrams, globes, aerial photographs and Geographical Information Systems (GIS).\u00a0 \u2022 Developing the skills to collect, analyse and present a range of data, gathered through experiences of fieldwork, to deepen their understanding of key geographical processes. \u2022 Developing the skills to be able to communicate geographical information in a variety of ways, including through maps, numerical and quantitative skills at writing.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It is our intention that the Geography curriculum will be both stimulating and motivating in order to capture the pupil\u2019s curiosity and fuel their motivation to learn. The pupils should be provided with exciting learning opportunities so as they enjoy acquiring and developing their skills and knowledge and perceive the world as an interesting place. With a solid foundation upon which they can continue to build their knowledge, we hope that the children will continue to have a curiosity of the world throughout their life.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We encourage parents to take their children on local, national and international trips, then share their experiences on the school Twitter feed as well as \u2018Show and Tell\u2019 time in class. This greatly adds to their child\u2019s knowledge and understanding of the world around them.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The topics below are used to cover all areas of the geography and history National Curriculum. The order that they may be studied may vary within the year.<\/p>\n<p>FS1 and FS2 often share topics, Year 1 and year 2 have adopted a two year rolling cycle, as have years 3 and 4. Year 5 and year 6 work independently.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"84\"><\/td>\n<td width=\"100\">TERM 1:1<\/td>\n<td width=\"111\">TERM 1:2<\/td>\n<td width=\"92\">TERM 2:1<\/td>\n<td width=\"101\">TERM 2:2<\/td>\n<td width=\"109\">TERM 3:1<\/td>\n<td width=\"109\">TERM 3:2<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"84\">FS1<\/td>\n<td width=\"100\">Myself<\/td>\n<td width=\"111\">Special Times<\/td>\n<td width=\"92\">People Who Help Us<\/td>\n<td width=\"101\">Water<\/td>\n<td width=\"109\">Minibeasts<\/td>\n<td width=\"109\">In And Around The world<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"84\">FS2<\/td>\n<td width=\"100\">Traditional Stories<\/td>\n<td width=\"111\">Special times<\/td>\n<td width=\"92\">Animals<\/td>\n<td width=\"101\">Why, how, What if<\/td>\n<td width=\"109\">Growth<\/td>\n<td width=\"109\">Superhero Charlie Around the World<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"84\">YEAR 1<\/td>\n<td width=\"100\">Memory box<\/td>\n<td width=\"111\">Fire and Ice<\/td>\n<td width=\"92\">Ready, Steady Cook<\/td>\n<td width=\"101\">Under the sea<\/td>\n<td width=\"109\">Planes,Trains and Automobiles<\/td>\n<td width=\"109\">Planes,Trains and Automobiles<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"84\">YEAR 2<\/td>\n<td width=\"100\">Paws, Claws and Whiskers<\/td>\n<td width=\"111\">Superheroes.<\/td>\n<td width=\"92\">Castles, knights and dragons<\/td>\n<td width=\"101\">Wonderful Woodland<\/td>\n<td width=\"109\">Space<\/td>\n<td width=\"109\">At the seaside<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"84\">YEAR 3<\/td>\n<td width=\"100\">Rivers<\/td>\n<td width=\"111\">Natural disasters<\/td>\n<td width=\"92\">Vicious Vikings<\/td>\n<td width=\"101\">Woeful World War 2<\/td>\n<td width=\"109\">Steel City\/Local study<\/td>\n<td width=\"109\">Whose House Is This?<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"84\">YEAR 4<\/td>\n<td width=\"100\">Stone Age to Iron Age<\/td>\n<td width=\"111\"><\/td>\n<td width=\"92\">Roman Empire<\/td>\n<td width=\"101\"><\/td>\n<td width=\"109\">Comparison of a European Country and UK<\/td>\n<td width=\"109\"><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"84\">YEAR 5<\/td>\n<td width=\"100\">Tudors<\/td>\n<td width=\"111\">Rainforests<\/td>\n<td width=\"92\">Polar regions<\/td>\n<td width=\"101\">What have the Greeks ever done for us?<\/td>\n<td width=\"109\">Seaside\/ Scarborough residential<\/td>\n<td width=\"109\"><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"84\">YEAR 6<\/td>\n<td width=\"100\">Egypt and River Nile<\/td>\n<td width=\"111\"><\/td>\n<td width=\"92\"><\/td>\n<td width=\"101\"><\/td>\n<td width=\"109\">Mayan Civilisation<\/td>\n<td width=\"109\">River Don over time<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Useful Websites:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.snaithprimary.eril.net\/\">http:\/\/www.snaithprimary.eril.net\/<\/a> A really lovely collection of topic based articles, stories and images (Mainly history or F\/S based).<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.topmarks.co.uk\/\">http:\/\/www.topmarks.co.uk\/<\/a> Contains links to interactive resources based on all subject areas.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sparklebox.co.uk\/\">http:\/\/www.sparklebox.co.uk\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.childrensuniversity.manchester.ac.uk\/\">http:\/\/www.childrensuniversity.manchester.ac.uk\/<\/a>\u00a0 A very odd combination of random Science, History, Art and Literacy activities but interactive and fun!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.coxhoe.durham.sch.uk\/\">http:\/\/www.coxhoe.durham.sch.uk\/<\/a> Go to \u2018curriculum\u2019 and choose the subject you are interested in \u2013 there are links to many other sites with plenty of interactive resources.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.primaryresources.co.uk\/\">http:\/\/www.primaryresources.co.uk\/<\/a> Plenty of worksheets and PowerPoint presentations covering most of the core areas of the curriculum.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/schools\/\">http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/schools\/<\/a> Age appropriate, subject specific activities, games, worksheets and experiments.
