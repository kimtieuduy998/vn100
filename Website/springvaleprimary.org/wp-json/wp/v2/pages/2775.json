Often, children who are entitled to pupil premium face challenges such as poor language and communication skills, less family support, lack of confidence and issues with attendance and punctuality. The pupil premium is intended to directly benefit the children who are eligible, helping to narrow the gap between them and their classmates.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Is your child eligible?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><strong>Schools are given a pupil premium for:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Children who have qualified for free school meals at any point in the past six years. The school receives \u00a31300 for each of these children.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Children who have been looked after under local authority care for more than one day. These children are awarded a premium of \u00a31900.<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><strong>How is it spent?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><strong>Schools can choose how to spend their pupil premium money, as they are best placed to identify what would be of most benefit to the children who are eligible.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Common ways in which schools spend their pupil premium fund include:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Extra one-to-one or small-group support for children within the classroom.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Employing extra teaching assistants to work with classes.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Running catch-up sessions before or after school, for example for children who need extra help with maths or literacy.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Running a school breakfast club to improve attendance.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Providing music lessons for children whose families would be unable to pay for them.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Partially funding educational trips and visits.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Paying for additional help such as speech and language therapy or family therapy.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Funding English classes for children who speak another language at home.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Investing in resources that boost children\u2019s learning, such as laptops or tablets.<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>However, some schools use their pupil premium in more creative ways. In the annual Pupil Premium Awards, recent winners spent their money on a bike for a child who was repeatedly late for school due to missing the bus, a nutritionist for a Year 5 child whose poor diet was causing behavioural and learning difficulties, and shoes and school uniform \u2013 including a PE kit \u2013 for a disadvantaged child in Year 3.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Often, all of the children in a class will reap some benefit from how the school spends its pupil premium: for example, if the money is used to fund an additional teaching assistant who works across the whole class, rather than providing one-to-one support. But research shows that the fund does help to narrow gaps between disadvantaged children and their peers, particularly in English and maths.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Can you influence how the pupil premium is used?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><strong>There is no obligation for your school to consult you about how they use the money they claim for your child, although some schools may involve parents. However, schools do have to show that they are using their pupil premium fund appropriately. This is measured through Ofsted inspections and annual performance tables showing the progress made by children who are eligible for pupil premium. In addition, they have to publish details online, including how much money they have been allocated, how they intend to spend it, how they spent their previous year\u2019s allocation and how it made a difference to the attainment of disadvantaged pupils.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3><strong>How to claim your child\u2019s pupil premium<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><strong>Your child may be eligible for free school meals \u2013 and accordingly pupil premium \u2013 if you receive any of the following benefits:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Income support<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Income-based jobseekers\u2019 allowance<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Income-related employment and support allowance<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Support under Part IV of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>The guaranteed element of state pension credit<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Child tax credit, provided that you are not also entitled to working tax credit and have an annual gross income of \u00a316,190 or less<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Universal credit<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Your child\u2019s school will be able to tell you what you need to do to register your child as eligible.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>From September 2014, all children in Reception and Years 1 and 2 will qualify for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theschoolrun.com\/free-school-meals-for-infant-children\">free school meals<\/a>, regardless of their family income, but only the children who would have qualified for free meals under the above income-based criteria will receive the pupil premium.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>If your child qualifies for free school meals, it\u2019s important that you tell their school \u2013 even if they take a packed lunch \u2013 as this enables them to claim pupil premium.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"5614\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/springvaleprimary.org\/pupil-premium\/springvale-image\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/springvaleprimary.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Springvale-Image.jpg?fit=1800%2C1272&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1800,1272\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Springvale Image\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/springvaleprimary.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Springvale-Image.jpg?fit=300%2C212&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/springvaleprimary.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Springvale-Image.jpg?fit=1024%2C724&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-5614 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/springvaleprimary.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Springvale-Image.jpg?resize=300%2C212&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"212\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/springvaleprimary.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Springvale-Image.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/springvaleprimary.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Springvale-Image.jpg?w=768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/springvaleprimary.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Springvale-Image.jpg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/springvaleprimary.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Springvale-Image.jpg?w=1800&amp;ssl=1 1800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"post__title\">Sports Premium<\/h2>\n<h2 class=\"post__title\">Springvale\u00a0Primary School Sport Premium 2017-2018<\/h2>\n<div class=\"post__body\">\n<h2>Our Vision for Sport and PE<\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>At\u00a0Springvale\u00a0Primary School\u00a0we hope that all pupils leave this primary school physically literate and with the knowledge, skills and motivation necessary to equip them for a healthy lifestyle and lifelong participation in physical activity and sport.<\/p>\n<h3>Springvale\u00a0Primary School Sport Premium Objective<\/h3>\n<p>The PE and Sport Premium has enabled\u00a0Springvale Primary School to improve the quality of PE and sports activities that we offer and helped us to achieve self-sustaining improvement in the quality of PE and sport we offer.
