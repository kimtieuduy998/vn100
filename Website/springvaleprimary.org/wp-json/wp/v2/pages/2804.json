They are designed to guide and shape pupils\u2019 learning in RE across the years of schooling. Of course, pupils begin to handle the key questions very simply, moving on to learn about and respond to religious objects and ideas, to describe for themselves, to analyse information, and increasingly to develop the ability to draw thoughtful and balanced conclusions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Question 1<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Why are these words special?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Sacred books<\/p>\n<p>KS1: Pupils learn to name some holy books and talk about the stories from them that they have heard.<\/p>\n<p>KS2: Pupils learn to describe the stories and teachings of holy books, and make links with their own lives and ideas<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Question 2<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Why are some places special?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Local places of worship, objects, artefacts, signs and<\/p>\n<p>symbols, sacred sites and pilgrimages<\/p>\n<p>KS1: Pupils learn about places of worship, what they are like and how special they are, and about objects and artefacts associated with them. Pupils find out about some places where<\/p>\n<p>religious people love to go and remember \u2013 and think of their own favourite places.<\/p>\n<p>KS2: Pupils learn to describe different places of worship and their symbols, and link ideas about peace, strength, love or courage to ideas about worship. Pupils learn that pilgrimages come in many forms in different religions, making links to the idea of \u2018life as a journey\u2019<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Question 3<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>How can faith contribute to Community<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Cohesion?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Beliefs, ethics, family traditions and faith in the<\/p>\n<p>Community<\/p>\n<p>KS1: Pupils learn about the ways being religious makes a difference in a family. Pupils learn that our society includes many religions, and all are worth respecting. In our area or region, they can all be seen first hand.<\/p>\n<p><strong>KS2: <\/strong>Pupils learn to describe what difference believing makes in some religions, and to describe their own beliefs, linking them to religious ones. Pupils describe some of the ways a religion is expressed and the impact the faith has on community life.
