Children are naturally fascinated by everything in the world around them and Science makes a valuable contribution to their understanding. Children learn by playing with things in their world. They pick up clues about what they see, touch, smell, taste and hear in order to makes sense of it all. Eventually they come to conclusions which they match up with all the experiences they have had.<\/p>\n<p>Collaboratively, teachers, parents and carers, can help children to take a second, careful look at the world. By talking together, children can be encouraged to explore and observe so that they can group objects and events and look for similarities and differences. They will need to measure and record the things they have found out in ways that make sense to them so that later they can talk to other people about what they have discovered. They should be encouraged to understand how science can be used to explain what is occurring, predict how things will behave, and analyse causes.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Aims: The national curriculum for science aims to ensure that all pupils:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>develop lively, enquiring minds and the ability to question.<\/li>\n<li>learn scientific skills and knowledge.<\/li>\n<li>build on their natural curiosity and enable them to understand and care for the world in which they live.<\/li>\n<li>are provided with an environment where they can work in an investigative way and can communicate their findings in a variety of ways.<\/li>\n<li>Can use equipment safely and sensibly.<\/li>\n<li>develop the potential scientific links with all other areas of the curriculum.<\/li>\n<li>develop scientific knowledge and conceptual understanding through the specific disciplines of biology, chemistry and physics.<\/li>\n<li>develop understanding of the nature, processes and methods of science through different types of science enquiries that help them to answer scientific questions about the world around them.<\/li>\n<li>are equipped with the scientific knowledge required to understand the uses and implications of science, today and for the future.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>All staff at Springvale strive to ensure that our children reach their full potential in Science and that they understand and enjoy their experiences through work schemes that promote the child\u2019s development and self-esteem.<\/p>\n<p><u>Overview of units<\/u><\/p>\n<table width=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"94\"><\/td>\n<td width=\"113\"><\/td>\n<td width=\"92\"><\/td>\n<td width=\"92\"><\/td>\n<td width=\"93\"><\/td>\n<td width=\"92\"><\/td>\n<td width=\"92\"><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"94\">Year 1<\/td>\n<td rowspan=\"2\" width=\"113\">Working scientifically<\/td>\n<td width=\"92\">Plants<\/td>\n<td width=\"92\">Animals, including humans<\/td>\n<td width=\"93\">Everyday materials<\/td>\n<td width=\"92\">Seasonal change<\/td>\n<td width=\"92\"><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"94\">Year 2<\/td>\n<td width=\"92\">Plants<\/td>\n<td width=\"92\">Animals, including humans<\/td>\n<td width=\"93\">Use of everyday material<\/td>\n<td width=\"92\">All living things and their habitats<\/td>\n<td width=\"92\"><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"94\">Year 3<\/td>\n<td rowspan=\"2\" width=\"113\">Working scientifically<\/td>\n<td width=\"92\">Plants<\/td>\n<td width=\"92\">Animals, including humans<\/td>\n<td width=\"93\">Rocks<\/td>\n<td width=\"92\">Lights<\/td>\n<td width=\"92\">Forces and magnets<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"94\">Year 4<\/td>\n<td width=\"92\">All living things<\/td>\n<td width=\"92\">Animals, including humans<\/td>\n<td width=\"93\">States of matter<\/td>\n<td width=\"92\">Sound<\/td>\n<td width=\"92\">Electricity<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"94\">Year 5<\/td>\n<td rowspan=\"2\" width=\"113\">Working scientifically<\/td>\n<td width=\"92\">All living things<\/td>\n<td width=\"92\">Animals, including humans<\/td>\n<td width=\"93\">Properties and changes of materials<\/td>\n<td width=\"92\">Earth and Space<\/td>\n<td width=\"92\">Forces<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"94\">Year 6<\/td>\n<td width=\"92\">All living things<\/td>\n<td width=\"92\">Animals, including humans<\/td>\n<td width=\"93\">Evolution and inheritance<\/td>\n<td width=\"92\">Light<\/td>\n<td width=\"92\">Electricity<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Multi-Cultural links will be developed wherever possible in the teaching of this National Curriculum subject.
