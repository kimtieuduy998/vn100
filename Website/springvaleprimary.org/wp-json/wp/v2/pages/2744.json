This will start after the October half term holiday. We are also given the opportunity to showcase our talents by performing at the Metrodome, at the end of the year, alongside other schools.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Homework<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The children will be given a homework to complete at the beginning of every new topic. Homework will be based on our topic but children will be able to complete it by producing anything from a Minecraft model to a poster or book. They also need to make sure that they fill out their reading logs and practice their times tables and spellings daily. Reading logs will be checked each Tuesday. If you read every day each week, you will get a merit! Spellings will be tested each Tuesday, children will be given a week to learn them. We will be using Spelling Frame to support our spellings.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; Welcome to our\u00a0Year\u00a03\u00a0Class Page!
